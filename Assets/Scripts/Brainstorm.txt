Brainstorm

Each team has a stance
Each stance causes the units to behave and move differently

I need to somehow combine the stance and behaviour together

Strategy
	Stance
	params

(Stance, params)

Team
	Color	//Does not change
	UserType	//Does not change
	Stance //can change
	Strategy

GameController
	BeginMatch()
		Init all teams to settings

		Teams
			Get goal
			Get fences
			Spawn units
			Set team and colors
			Reset stats
			Despawn units

//Start game sequence
• User starts new game
• Controller
	- inits both teams and passes through settings
	- starts match and starts round

Goals


Fences
	- sets team and color
Unit
	- set team and color
	- hide indicators


Team
	inits and colors team objects ie. fences, goals
	X inits and preloads Units
	X units are shoved back into object pool right away?
	-
	Controls object pools for Units
	Spawns

Unit
	Spawn
		Conditions:
			user clicks on field
			CPU requests unit to spawn successfully
			there is enough energy
			location is the correct field
		spawn unit at location using object pool (screw preloading)
			if object pool is empty then it will use CreateUnit() to create,
		OnGetUnit() will be run on the unit no matter what

	OnGetUnit(Unit)
		set team
		set spawn time
		Activate()

	Activate()
		Condition:
			inactive < 0
		set team, strategy, color
		set agent radius to normal?

	Deactivate()
		Conditions:
			unit gets caught by opponent while holding the ball
			unit catches an opponent
		set inactive to params.reactivationTime
		set color to grayscale
		set agent radius to 0.1 so that units can pass through?

	Despawn
		Conditions:
			unit hits the opponent's fence
		Gets shoved back into the object pool
			Hide; set active false

	OnRecycleUnit(Unit)
