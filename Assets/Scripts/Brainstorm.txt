Brainstorm
==========

--------
Intro
--------
Just let the game run by itself while a cinemachine camera flys around the stadium at medium distance while focusing on the ball


--------
End Match
--------
On Win / Lose
	Display screen showing who won
	Stats
		Wins / losses
		Draws
		Passes
		Despawns
		etc
	Display MainMenu
		Button: AR Toggle
		Button: Sound
		Button: Info?




----------
What does GameController.isPlaying control?
----------
GameController.Update()
GameController.TickTeams()
Unit.Update()
Unit.Tick()
In other words it controls the team and unit logic and AI

-----------
AR Mode
----------
? How will switching work?
! MainMenu.TapToStart blocks input
!

Tap the AR mode toggle button on the home screen
	Load AR scene
		temporarily turn off main menu tap to start sensor
		Scan for a suitable plane
			If one is found, hover the stadium over
			else hide it 1000m above
		ARCanvas.TapSensor > tap to place the stadium down
		Set flat that assembly has been placed

		Turn on main menu tap to start detector
	Resume as normal

Switching back to normal mode
	No changes to main menu


---------------------------
Tag out sequence
----------------------
Defender touches Attacker
Defender tags Attacker out
	Attacker passes ball to nearest Team mate
		Attacker deactivates
		Attacker passes ball
		Attacker sets nearest team mate to receiver
			Receiver stops and turns and faces the ball

	If no one left then lose round

Defender runs Attacker.TagOut()
	Attacker.PassBall()
		Team.FindNearestActiveUnit()



----------------------------
How to calculate the time required based on distance and speed
---------------------------
Time = Distance / Speed


----------------------
MENU

	Main, Maybe MainMenu can be put into Main and made to Dontdestroyonload
	AR

--------------
Each team has a stance
Each stance causes the units to behave and move differently

I need to somehow combine the stance and behaviour together

Strategy
	Stance
	params

(Stance, params)

Team
	Color	//Does not change
	UserType	//Does not change
	Stance //can change
	Strategy

GameController
	BeginMatch()
		Init all teams to settings

		Teams
			Get goal
			Get fences
			Spawn units
			Set team and colors
			Reset stats
			Despawn units

---------------
Start game sequence
-------------------
• User starts new game
• Controller
	- inits both teams and passes through settings
	- starts match and starts round

Goal
	SetTeam
		Sets team and strategy
		Sets color
	If opponent unit collides
		if unit has ball then score a goal to the opposite team
		else despawn unit

Fences
	Sets team and color
	If opponent team hits then despawn

Team
	inits and colors team objects ie. fences, goals
	X inits and preloads Units
	X units are shoved back into object pool right away?

	Each team handles their own units
		Creates and controls object pools for Units
		Spawns units using pool
		Despawns units





Unit
	Each unit controls itself using AI logic


	SetTeam
		set team, strategy and color

	Spawn
		Conditions:
			user clicks on field
			CPU requests unit to spawn successfully
			there is enough energy
			location is the correct field
		spawn unit at location using object pool (screw preloading)
			if object pool is empty then it will use CreateUnit() to create,
		OnGetUnit() will be run on the unit no matter what

	OnGetUnit(Unit)
		set team
		set spawn time
		Activate()

	Activate()
		Condition:
			inactive < 0
		set team, strategy, color
		set agent radius to normal?

	Deactivate()
		Conditions:
			unit gets caught by opponent while holding the ball
			unit catches an opponent
		set inactive to params.reactivationTime
		set color to grayscale
		set agent radius to 0.1 so that units can pass through?

	Despawn
		Conditions:
			unit hits the opponent's fence
		Gets shoved back into the object pool
			Hide; set active false

	OnRecycleUnit(Unit)
