Brainstorm

Each team has a stance
Each stance causes the units to behave and move differently

I need to somehow combine the stance and behaviour together

Strategy
	Stance
	params

(Stance, params)

Team
	Color	//Does not change
	UserType	//Does not change
	Stance //can change
	Strategy

GameController
	BeginMatch()
		Init all teams to settings

		Teams
			Get goal
			Get fences
			Spawn units
			Set team and colors
			Reset stats
			Despawn units
